<h1 id="faqs">FAQs</h1>
<p>The following are frequently asked questions about <strong>Hyperion
and its hardware accelerators.</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-is-hyperion">What is Hyperion?</h2>
<p><strong>Hyperion</strong> is an on-premises acceleration platform
that streamlines the development of complex acceleration applications by
combining modern energy-efficient multi-core servers, reconfigurable and
specialized processors (such as ACAPs, FPGAs, multi-core CPUs, and
GPUs), and a customized RunTime. With a focus on empowering specialized
hardware engineers, data scientists, and research institutions, Hyperion
is specifically designed to address the demands of modern workloads
solving diverse computing-intensive tasks.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-hyperion-intended-for">Who is Hyperion intended for?</h2>
<p>Hyperion is tailored for highly specialized acceleration engineers
working in research laboratories or universities. Alongside its RunTime,
these engineers benefit not just from a dedicated on-site platform for
development and testing but also from its integrated command-line
interpreter (CLI) and an API, enabling seamless management and
programming of all computing devices.</p>
<h2 id="is-hyperion-hosted-in-the-public-cloud">Is Hyperion hosted in
the public cloud?</h2>
<p>No, Hyperion is designed to be an on-premises resource for edge
computing. However, you have the option to build your private cloud
using Hyperion servers and offer your accelerated services by exposing
them.</p>

sales department will reach out to you shortly.</p>
<h2 id="how-are-my-hyperion-instances-maintained">How are my Hyperion
instances maintained?</h2>
<p>Hyperion is a managed platform, allowing us to provide remote
maintenance for your Hyperion servers. We ensure the health and keep
them up-to-date, including the operating system, acceleration
development tools, and the devices themselves.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-build-accelerated-applications-on-hyperion">How do I
build accelerated applications on Hyperion?</h2>
<p>Hyperion includes Hyperion RunTime (HRT), featuring a CLI and an API.
The command-line interpreter assists in building customized accelerated
applications—tailored to your Hyperion instance’s underlying
hardware—and sets up the infrastructure accordingly. Additionally, the
API streamlines development, allowing seamless utilization of all
exposed devices (ACAPs, FPGAs, multi-core CPUs, and GPUs) in your source
code.</p>
<h2 id="what-type-of-accelerator-is-a-multi-core-cpu">What type of
accelerator is a multi-core CPU?</h2>
<p>A multi-core CPU (Central Processing Unit) is a <strong>scalar
processor</strong> that contains multiple processing cores on a single
chip, each of which can execute instructions independently of others.
While multi-core CPUs are not typically considered accelerators like
GPUs or FPGAs, they can provide a significant performance boost for
certain types of workloads, particularly those that involve a mix of
sequential and parallel computations for multi-threaded
applications.</p>
<h2 id="what-type-of-accelerator-is-a-gpu">What type of accelerator is a
GPU?</h2>
<p>A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a <strong>vector processing
device</strong> initially designed to accelerate graphical computations
by performing many calculations in parallel on large sets of data, such
as pixels in an image or vertices in a 3D model. In recent years, GPUs
have been used for other applications beyond graphics, such as
scientific computing, machine learning, or cryptography. All these use
cases (as well as image processing tasks) require calculations that can
be done more efficiently using vector-based techniques that allow for
the simultaneous parallel processing of multiple data elements.</p>
<p>Modern GPUs typically have hundreds (or even thousands) of processing
cores and specialized hardware for handling vector operations—such as
SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) units.</p>
<h2 id="what-type-of-accelerator-is-an-fpga">What type of accelerator is
an FPGA?</h2>
<p>An FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is commonly classified as a
<strong>spatial processing device.</strong> They benefit from a
different computational model, coding styles, and forms of parallelism
than traditional <a
href="./vocabulary.md#instruction-set-architecture-isa-processors">Instruction
Set Architecture (ISA) processors,</a> including CPUs and GPUs, which
are more familiar to most people.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional ISA processors—designed to execute a sequence of
memory-stored instructions in a program, running on a fixed hardware
architecture that can run different instructions at different
times—FPGAs start from the opposite perspective. Instead of being based
around a machine that executes instructions on shared hardware, spatial
implementations of a program conceptually take the entire program and
lay it down at once on the device. This way, each instruction in the
program receives its dedicated hardware that can execute simultaneously
(in the same clock cycle) as all other instructions in the program—as
they are spatially decoupled in the device.</p>
<p>In many ways, this differs from ISA devices: an FPGA does not have a
pre-defined instruction set, and the logic functions it performs are
entirely determined by the user’s programming; furthermore, they do not
share hardware between instructions over time—as it happens with scalar
and vector processors.</p>
<h2 id="what-type-of-accelerator-is-an-acap">What type of accelerator is
an ACAP?</h2>
<p>An ACAP (Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform) is a type of
programmable hardware accelerator that combines the capabilities of both
GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate
Arrays) into a single platform.</p>
<p>Like GPUs, ACAPs have a high number of processing cores and
specialized hardware for handling vector-based operations and other
compute-intensive tasks. Like FPGAs, ACAPs have a re-programmable
spatial processing region that benefits from such architectures by
performing application-specific operations in dedicated reconfigurable
hardware.</p>
<p>Overall, ACAPs are designed to provide a flexible and adaptable
platform for accelerating a broader type of compute-intensive workloads
in a single device.</p>
<h2 id="is-my-application-gpu--or-fpga-like">Is my application GPU- or
FPGA-like?</h2>
<p>FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and GPUs (Graphics Processing
Units) are both powerful computing platforms, but they have different
strengths and weaknesses that make them suitable for different types of
applications. In general, GPUs are better for applications that require
massive parallelism and high-throughput computation, while FPGAs are
best suited for applications that require high-speed data processing and
low-latency operation.</p>
<p>Some examples of applications that are better suited for GPUs
include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Graphics rendering and video game development</li>
<li>Scientific computing and simulations</li>
<li>Machine learning training</li>
<li>Cryptocurrency mining</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, some examples of applications that are better
suited for FPGAs include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Real-time signal processing and digital signal processing (DSP)</li>
<li>High-frequency trading (HFT) and financial modeling</li>
<li>Machine learning inference and deep learning</li>
<li>Network packet processing and network security</li>
<li>Video and image processing</li>
</ol>
<p>However, with Hyperion both FPGAs and GPUs can be used in conjunction
with each other to accelerate complex workloads that require both
parallel processing and low latency.</p>
