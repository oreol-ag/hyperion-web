    <h1>Hyperion FAQs</h1>

    <p class="content">The following are frequently asked questions about <strong>Hyperion
    and its hardware accelerators.</strong></p>
    <h2 id="what-is-hyperion">What is Hyperion?</h2>
    <p class="content">Hyperion is a ready-to-use acceleration platform combining
    energy-efficient servers with advanced acceleration devices such as
    ACAPs, FPGAs, multi-core CPUs, and GPUs. It also includes a customized
    command-line interpreter (CLI) and an API, bundled as Hyperion RunTime
    (HRT), for seamless management and programming of these devices.</p>
    <h2 id="who-is-hyperion-intended-for">Who is Hyperion intended for?</h2>
    <p class="content">Hyperion is created to simplify the process of developing complex
    acceleration applications, primarily serving highly specialized
    acceleration engineers working at research institutions or universities.
    These engineers typically benefit from dedicated on-site hardware for
    development, testing, and staging before transitioning to
    production.</p>
    <h2 id="is-hyperion-hosted-in-the-public-cloud">Is Hyperion hosted in
    the public cloud?</h2>
    <p class="content">No, Hyperion is designed to be an on-premises resource for edge
    computing. However, you have the option to build your private cloud
    using Hyperion servers and offer your accelerated services by exposing
    them.</p>
    <h2 id="how-can-i-begin-using-hyperion">How can I begin using
    Hyperion?</h2>
    <p class="content">You can get started by trying out a few Hyperion instances available
    online for free evaluation. Simply sign in here to give it a try.</p>
    <h2 id="how-can-i-purchase-hyperion">How can I purchase Hyperion?</h2>
    <p class="content">To obtain Hyperion instances, please complete this form, and our
    sales department will reach out to you shortly.</p>
    <h2 id="how-are-my-hyperion-instances-maintained">How are my Hyperion
    instances maintained?</h2>
    <p class="content">Hyperion is a managed platform, allowing us to provide remote
    maintenance for your Hyperion servers. We ensure the health and keep
    them up-to-date, including the operating system, acceleration
    development tools, and the devices themselves.</p>
    <h2 id="how-do-i-build-accelerated-applications-on-hyperion">How do I
    build accelerated applications on Hyperion?</h2>
    <p class="content">Hyperion includes Hyperion RunTime (HRT), featuring a CLI and an API.
    The command-line interpreter assists in building customized accelerated
    applications—tailored to your Hyperion instance’s underlying
    hardware—and sets up the infrastructure accordingly. Additionally, the
    API streamlines development, allowing seamless utilization of all
    exposed devices (ACAPs, FPGAs, multi-core CPUs, and GPUs) in your source
    code.</p>
    <h2 id="what-type-of-accelerator-is-a-multi-core-cpu">What type of
    accelerator is a multi-core CPU?</h2>
    <p class="content">A multi-core CPU (Central Processing Unit) is a <strong>scalar
    processor</strong> that contains multiple processing cores on a single
    chip, each of which can execute instructions independently of others.
    While multi-core CPUs are not typically considered accelerators like
    GPUs or FPGAs, they can provide a significant performance boost for
    certain types of workloads, particularly those that involve a mix of
    sequential and parallel computations for multi-threaded
    applications.</p>
    <h2 id="what-type-of-accelerator-is-a-gpu">What type of accelerator is a
    GPU?</h2>
    <p class="content">A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a <strong>vector processing
    device</strong> initially designed to accelerate graphical computations
    by performing many calculations in parallel on large sets of data, such
    as pixels in an image or vertices in a 3D model. In recent years, GPUs
    have been used for other applications beyond graphics, such as
    scientific computing, machine learning, or cryptography. All these use
    cases (as well as image processing tasks) require calculations that can
    be done more efficiently using vector-based techniques that allow for
    the simultaneous parallel processing of multiple data elements.</p>
    <p class="content">Modern GPUs typically have hundreds (or even thousands) of processing
    cores and specialized hardware for handling vector operations—such as
    SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) units.</p>
    <h2 id="what-type-of-accelerator-is-an-fpga">What type of accelerator is
    an FPGA?</h2>
    <p class="content">An FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is commonly classified as a
    <strong>spatial processing device.</strong> They benefit from a
    different computational model, coding styles, and forms of parallelism
    than traditional <a
    href="./vocabulary.md#instruction-set-architecture-isa-processors">Instruction
    Set Architecture (ISA) processors,</a> including CPUs and GPUs, which
    are more familiar to most people.</p>
    <p class="content">Unlike traditional ISA processors—designed to execute a sequence of
    memory-stored instructions in a program, running on a fixed hardware
    architecture that can run different instructions at different
    times—FPGAs start from the opposite perspective. Instead of being based
    around a machine that executes instructions on shared hardware, spatial
    implementations of a program conceptually take the entire program and
    lay it down at once on the device. This way, each instruction in the
    program receives its dedicated hardware that can execute simultaneously
    (in the same clock cycle) as all other instructions in the program—as
    they are spatially decoupled in the device.</p>
    <p class="content">In many ways, this differs from ISA devices: an FPGA does not have a
    pre-defined instruction set, and the logic functions it performs are
    entirely determined by the user’s programming; furthermore, they do not
    share hardware between instructions over time—as it happens with scalar
    and vector processors.</p>
    <h2 id="what-type-of-accelerator-is-an-acap">What type of accelerator is
    an ACAP?</h2>
    <p class="content">An ACAP (Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform) is a type of
    programmable hardware accelerator that combines the capabilities of both
    GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate
    Arrays) into a single platform.</p>
    <p class="content">Like GPUs, ACAPs have a high number of processing cores and
    specialized hardware for handling vector-based operations and other
    compute-intensive tasks. Like FPGAs, ACAPs have a re-programmable
    spatial processing region that benefits from such architectures by
    performing application-specific operations in dedicated reconfigurable
    hardware.</p>
    <p class="content">Overall, ACAPs are designed to provide a flexible and adaptable
    platform for accelerating a broader type of compute-intensive workloads
    in a single device.</p>
    <h2 id="is-my-application-gpu--or-fpga-like">Is my application GPU- or
    FPGA-like?</h2>
    <p class="content">FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and GPUs (Graphics Processing
    Units) are both powerful computing platforms, but they have different
    strengths and weaknesses that make them suitable for different types of
    applications. In general, GPUs are better for applications that require
    massive parallelism and high-throughput computation, while FPGAs are
    best suited for applications that require high-speed data processing and
    low-latency operation.</p>
    <p class="content">Some examples of applications that are better suited for GPUs
    include:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p class="content">Graphics rendering and video game development</p></li>
    <li><p class="content">Scientific computing and simulations</p></li>
    <li><p class="content">Machine learning training</p></li>
    <li><p class="content">Cryptocurrency mining</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="content">On the other hand, some examples of applications that are better
    suited for FPGAs include:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p class="content">Real-time signal processing and digital signal processing (DSP)</p></li>
    <li><p class="content">High-frequency trading (HFT) and financial modeling</p></li>
    <li><p class="content">Machine learning inference and deep learning</p></li>
    <li><p class="content">Network packet processing and network security</p></li>
    <li><p class="content">Video and image processing</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="content">However, with Hyperion both FPGAs and GPUs can be used in conjunction
    with each other to accelerate complex workloads that require both
    parallel processing and low latency.</p>
