## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) processors
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is a type of computer architecture that defines the programming model of a processor. ISA is closely related to [the Von Neumann model,](#the-von-neumann-model) which is a theoretical framework for how most of computers work. As an implementation of such a model, ISA defines the instructions that the CPU (Central Processing Unit) can execute, as well as how the CPU interacts with memory and other components of the system. The ISA also determines the format of the machine language that software developers use to write programs for the processor.

The Von Neumann model and ISA architectures form the basis for many modern computer systems and are essential for understanding how computers work at a fundamental level.

Multi-core CPUs and GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit) are considered ISA processors; FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Array) is considered as a non-ISA device.

## The Von Neumann model
The Von Neumann model describes a computer system as having a central processing unit (CPU), memory, input/output devices, and a bus that connects them all. In this model, the CPU fetches instructions and data from memory, executes the instructions, and stores the results back in memory. The Von Neumann model is used as a basis for many modern computer architectures, including [Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) processors.](#instruction-set-architecture-isa-processors)
